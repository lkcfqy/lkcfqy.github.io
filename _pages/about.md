# Research Profile: AI Architectures & Neuro-Symbolic Computing


**Research Focus:** AI Architectures, Neuro-Symbolic Computing, System-Level AI Optimization, and AI Safety.
**Portfolio:** [github.com/lkcfqy](https://github.com/lkcfqy)


---


## 🧠 1. Neuro-Symbolic & Cognitive Architectures


**Primary Research Focus**
I aim to bridge the gap between the learning adaptability of neural networks and the reasoning/interpretability of symbolic systems to build Agents that closer resemble biological intelligence.


* **Keywords:** Active Inference, Free Energy Principle (FEP), Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), Spiking Neural Networks (SNN).


### Key Projects


* **`aion`**: Explores intelligent drone control based on **Active Inference** and biologically inspired neural networks (LSM, MHN). The system simulates biological homeostasis mechanisms to achieve robust autonomous flight.
* **`friston`**: A Software Engineer Agent equipped with **"Hippocampal" memory consolidation** and multimodal perception. By combining **HDC** (Hyperdimensional Computing) with **AST** parsing, it achieves superior code repair capabilities compared to traditional LLM Agents.
* **`project_laplace`**: Integrates LLMs, **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, and HDC to solve the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** challenge. Features a novel "Wake-Sleep" mechanism for self-evolution and iterative improvement.

## ⚡ 2. Efficient AI Systems & HW-SW Co-design


**Hardware-Aware Optimization**
My research extends beyond algorithms into underlying hardware architectures. I investigate methods to overcome the "Memory Wall," specifically optimizing for **Long Context LLMs**.


* **Keywords:** CXL (Compute Express Link), Processing-in-Memory (PIM), KV Cache, SystemVerilog, Ramulator.


### Key Projects


* **`lkc-cxl-pim`**: Proposed a **hardware-software co-design** solution leveraging CXL and PIM to accelerate long **KV Cache retrieval** in LLMs. The project spans the full stack:
* High-level Python performance simulation.
* Low-level **SystemVerilog RTL** verification.
* Custom **Ramulator** development.

## 🎲 3. Causal Inference & Generative AI


**Robustness & Interpretability**
In the realm of Generative AI, I prioritize interpretability, robustness, and counterfactual reasoning over mere generation fidelity.


* **Keywords:** Structural Causal Models (SCM), Diffusion Models, Counterfactual Generation.


### Key Projects


* **`causal-diffusion-poc`**: Combines **causal inference** with **diffusion models**. By applying causal interventions and generating counterfactuals, this project enhances the robustness and controllability of image generation, ensuring the model understands *why* it generates specific features.

## 🛡️ 4. Blockchain Security & Applied AI


**Applied Research Track**
Focusing on leveraging machine learning to address security challenges and data analytics within the Web3 ecosystem.


* **Keywords:** Web3 Security, Phishing Detection, Random Forest, On-chain Monitoring.


### Key Projects


* **`web3-ai-sentry`**: A full-stack security system utilizing machine learning (**Random Forest**) to analyze on-chain Ethereum behavior in real-time. It identifies phishing addresses and provides alerts via a custom browser extension.
* **`crypto_alpha`**: Focuses on on-chain data analytics and high-probability wallet tracking to identify market trends.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Persona


| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cross-Layer Expertise** | Proven ability to execute full-stack research, ranging from low-level **Verilog hardware design** (`lkc-cxl-pim`) to high-level **cognitive Agent architectures** (`friston`) and Web applications (`web3-ai-sentry`). |
| **Vanguard of Paradigms** | Beyond the mainstream Transformer/Backprop orthodoxy, I actively explore biologically inspired computing methods like **Active Inference** and **HDC** to address inherent flaws in current AI energy efficiency, reasoning, and long-term memory. |
| **Theory to Practice** | I emphasize robust engineering alongside theoretical depth. Every project is backed by a **complete implementation** (Docker, CI/CD, modular architecture) grounded in rigorous theoretical frameworks (Causal Inference, Free Energy Principle). |
